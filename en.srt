1
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,780
- Hello? - Hi - Good afternoon.
- Who is this? - Who am I speaking with? - What?

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,680
- I want to know the name of the person I’m speaking with.
- Mauricio

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
- Ah - You can call me Mauricio or Mauri.
- Yes. - I’ll put you through to my mother.

4
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:44,130
- Yes. - Wait, wait.
- Mommy? - Yes? - Yes? - Tell me

5
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,000
- Is this a public phone? I don’t know where you want to talk, ma’am.

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,950
- Yes, it’s public.  
- Yes, you’re calling a public phone.

7
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,110
- This is a public phone.
- It’s public, but it’s my house.

8
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:04,150
- It doesn’t work anymore. - No, people don’t use it anymore.
- Honestly, I hardly see anyone using it now.

9
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,890
- This booth is hardly useful.
Some people call, but very few.

10
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:16,650
- No, it’s not working.
They left it for urgent service calls.

11
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,330
You call the PDI or the police at 1233.
- Very rarely.

12
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:28,110
- Yes, they do check them, and that,  
but lately I haven’t seen anyone taking the coins out.

13
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:35,670
- They removed the booths. We keep maintaining them,  
but there’s no use for booths anymore.

14
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,430
That is, they’re not really used.
With mobiles, they stopped being used.

15
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,550
- This phone at the high school?
Years ago.

16
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,710
It must be, I don’t know, around 30 years.
No, maybe 20 years.

17
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:58,870
- Yes, a very long time. More than 40 years.
- Yes, a long time ago, yes.

18
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:07,550
But well, this one, for many years, was  
the phone there, well, in a neighborhood.

19
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,150
There used to be many everywhere,  
but now not so much.

20
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,170
- There’s a public phone, but it’s broken.
- This is the only one we have. It’s a small town.

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,550
- There’s another one too.
- Only this one, the one I know here in Canelones.

22
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,410
- Yes, it’s the only one, of course.

23
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:31,610
- Throughout the municipality there were four public phones.
There are four or five parishes, one phone per parish.

24
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,910
It was like a public service.
- Yes, it’s inside like that.

25
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,510
- Yes, because it’s nice, a public phone  
inside a clinic, that’s why it’s answered.

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:48,110
- And of course, since it’s a bar, people would go to the bar,  
to the shop, and in the process make a call.

27
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,030
- No, it’s inside the office, but people can use it.

28
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,030
- No, on the street you can’t leave it  
because people break everything.

29
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,510
- Yes, the phone is always where we  
sometimes gather to play across the street.

30
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:13,210
- It’s the high school entrance - Inside the university.
- Yes, this line is in an educational center.

31
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,170
The bell just rang.

32
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,720
- I answered because it started ringing, but…
- Yes, because the phone was ringing…

33
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:34,540
It was strange that it rang. So I went to answer.
- You were lucky, right?

34
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,700
- No, no one ever called here.
- More for making calls than receiving.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,240
- It’s very rare. - No, it doesn’t receive calls either.
- Maybe one person calls all year.

36
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,620
- No, because this is a coin phone  
that practically doesn’t work.

37
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,400
People have mobile phones, and nothing, this doesn’t work.
It’s there because it was, and not to throw it away, but it doesn’t work.

38
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,880
- Now mobiles replaced public phones, so…

39
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:13,780
- Yes, yes. In some homes, they have four or five mobile phones.
Normally two per person.

40
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,140
No one complains, because, of course, with mobiles  
no one complains about the phone.

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,820
Well, look, I’ll tell you something.
- What?

42
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,220
- Excuse me a second. Look, this is  
a restaurant and we’re just serving food.

43
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,180
If you want to call me later, I’ll answer  
without any problem, okay?

44
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,980
- Okay, okay  
- Later, I’ll call you.

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,980
- At nine? - Whenever you want.
- Whenever you want.

46
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,300
You can ask for Roberto or Margarita, don’t  
worry. Either of them.

47
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,700
- Okay.  
- Thanks, bye.

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,300
