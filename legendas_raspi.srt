1
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,450
-Hello?
2
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:20,800
-Hi
3
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,160
-Good afternoon
4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,160
-Who is this?
5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,860
Who am I 
speakng with?
6
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,780
-What?
7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,070
-I want to know the
name of the person 
I’m speakng with
8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,680
-Mauricio
9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,900
-Ah
10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,040
You can call me 
Mauricio or Mauri
11
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:31,400
-Yes
12
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,400
-I’ll put you
through to my mother
13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,040
-Yes
14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:36,520
Eh
15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,460
Wait, wait 
16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,100
-Mommy?
17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:43,330
-Yes
18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,130
-Yes 
-Tell me
19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,830
-Is this a public
phone? I don’t know
where you want to
talk, ma’am.
20
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,950
-Yes it’s public 
-Yes you’re calling
a public phone
21
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,390
This is a 
public phone
22
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,100
It’s public, 
but it’s my house
23
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,070
It doesn’t 
work anymore
24
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,910
No, people don’t 
use it anymore
25
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,170
Honestly, I hardly
see anyone using 
it now
26
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,810
This booth is
hardly useful. Some
people call, but 
very few
27
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:16,930
No it’s not working
They left it for 
urgent service calls
28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,450
You call the PDI or
the police at 1233
-Very rarely
29
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:29,000
-Yes they do check
them, but lately I
haven’t seen anyone
taking the coins out
30
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,300
-They removed the
booths. We keep
maintaining them,
31
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,670
but there’s no use
for booths anymore
32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,430
That is, they’re not
really used.
With mobiles, they
stopped being used
33
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:46,510
-This phone at the 
high school? 
Years ago
34
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:52,990
It must be, 
I don’t know, 
around 30 years,
maybe 20 years
35
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,810
Yes a very long
time. More than 
40 years
36
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:06,070
-Yes a long time ago
-But well, this one,
for many years, was
the phone, well, in
37
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,550
let's say,
a neighborhood
38
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:12,150
There used to be 
many everywhere, 
but now, 
not so much
39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,790
There’s a public
phone, but it’s 
broken
40
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:17,170
This is the only
one we have

It’s a small town
41
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,650
There’s another one
-Only this one, the
one I know here in
Canelones
42
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,400
-Yes it’s the only
one, of course
43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,190
-Throughout the 
municipality there 
were 4 public phones
44
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,610
There are 4 or 5 
parishes, 1 phone
per parish
45
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,910
It was like a public
service

-Yes it’s inside
46
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,910
-Yes because it’s
nice, a public phone
inside a clinic,thats
why it’s answered
47
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,150
And of course since
it’s a bar, people 
would go to the bar,
to the shop, 
48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,510
and, in the process,
make a call
49
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,070
-No, it’s inside the
office, but people 
can use it.
50
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:58,450
-No, on the street
you can’t leave it
because people 
break everything
51
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:05,590
-Yes this phone is
where we sometimes 
gather to play across
the street
52
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,030
-It’s the 
high school entrance
-Inside the 
university
53
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,210
-Yes this line is
in an educational 
center
54
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,170
The bell just rang.
55
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,060
I answered because
it started ringing,
but…
56
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,720
-Yes because the 
phone was ringing
57
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,940
It was strange
that it rang.
So I came to answer
58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,600
It was luck, 
right?
59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,600
-No, no one ever
called here
60
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,860
-More for making
calls than receiving
61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,700
-It’s very rare
62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,620
-No, it doesn’t 
receive calls either
63
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,240
Maybe one person
calls all year.
64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,620
-No, because this
is a coin phone 
that practically
doesn’t work
65
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,000
People have mobile
phones, and this 
doesn’t work. It’s 
there because it was
66
00:03:57,160 -->  00:04:00,400
and not to throw it
away, but it 
doesn’t work
67
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,880
-Now mobiles
replaced public
phones, so
68
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,060
Yes yes
In some homes
they have 4 or 5
mobile phones
69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,980
Normally two 
per person
70
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,579
-No one complains,
because, of course,
with mobiles no one
need the phone
71
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,800
Well, look, I’ll 
tell you something
 
-What?
72
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,360
-Excuse me,
just a second
73
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,220
Look, this is 
a restaurant 
and we’re just 
serving food.
74
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,180
If you want to 
call me later,
I’ll answer without 
any problem, okay?
75
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,980
-Okay, okay 
-Later I’ll call you
76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,500
-At 9h?
-Whenever you want
77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,980
-Whenever you want
78
00:04:33,140 -->  00:04:35,280
-You can ask for
Roberto or Margarita
don’t worry
79
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,000
Either of them
80
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:37,820
-Okay.
-Thanks, bye
81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,300
