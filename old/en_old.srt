00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,000
Hello.

2
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:35,930
Hi.

3
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,740
Good afternoon.

4
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,640
Who is this?

5
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,690
Juan.

6
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:40,340
Is that your name?

7
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,090
Yes.

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,350
Who is speaking?

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,150
Mauricio.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,760
Can you call me…

11
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,270
Can you call me Mauricio?

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:50,930
Mauri.

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,880
From where?

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,000
This phone too.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,280
We have a store here.

16
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,590
I want to speak with whoever you want to see.

17
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,990
Should I put you through to my mother?

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,110
Yes.

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:07,440
Okay.

20
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,270
Hey, wait, wait.

21
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,820
Mom.

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,770
Yes, tell me.

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,170
This is a public phone.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,150
I don’t know where you want to talk, ma’am.

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,920
It is public.

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,470
You called a public phone.

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,820
This is a public phone.

28
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:30,750
It’s public.

29
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,710
But it’s my house.

30
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:32,250
No.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Look, this is a coin-operated phone that practically doesn’t work.

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,260
People have mobile phones now, so nothing.

33
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,500
This.

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,490
No, no, it doesn’t work.

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:41,820
This one.

36
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,020
This one, because it was there.

37
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,160
And they didn’t throw it away.

38
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,030
But it doesn’t work.

39
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,190
Because it’s public.

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,780
Right?

41
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,450
In front of the Cocinería, there is a public phone.

42
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,470
But it’s broken.

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,520
Doesn’t work.

44
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,290
Yes, it’s in the system, but…

45
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,580
I don’t see anyone using it.

46
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,780
Honestly, I hardly see people using it.

47
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,010
Very little, very little use for this booth.

48
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,960
Some people call, but very few.

49
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:12,280
Uh.

50
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,640
No, no, they don’t use it anymore.

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,410
It’s useless now.

52
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,940
Very few.

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,800
Eh?

54
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,300
From this phone, you can call local landlines.

55
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,900
Yes, from…

56
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,210
Yes, they can check them and all that.

57
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,560
But I haven’t seen anyone recently collecting coins.

58
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,390
No, it’s not working.

59
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,470
It’s…

60
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:35,950
It is.

61
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:44,470
Left for urgent service calls, like in case of an accident or a robbery.

62
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,550
You call the police or Carabineros at 1233.

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:49,900
Eh!

64
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,130
They removed the booths.

65
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:56,410
We still maintain them, but no one uses booths anymore.

66
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,170
Meaning no one uses it; with mobiles it stopped being used.

67
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,520
This phone has been in the school for years.

68
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:13,300
Must be like 30 years, or 20 maybe.

69
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,960
Yes, it has.

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,100
A very long time.

71
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,290
More than 40 years?

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,330
Yes, a long time.

73
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,980
But well, yes.

74
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,120
For many years, it was the main phone.

75
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:36,580
In a small town of about 100 inhabitants.

76
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,670
There used to be many places, but not anymore.

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,760
This is the only one we have, it’s a small town.

78
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,470
There’s another one.

79
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,020
Only this one I know in Canelones.

80
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,090
Here in Bella Unión, another, maybe 112 in total because the others were removed.

81
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,240
Yes, it’s the only one left.

82
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,010
Within the municipality, there were…

83
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,350
Four public phones.

84
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,010
Eh.

85
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,900
According to the…

86
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,320
Mmm.

87
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,320
How do you say?

88
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:10,970
Parishes.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,670
According to the parishes, each parish had one.

90
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,500
A public phone.

91
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:27,980
And here in the Rivera de Viking municipality, there were four or five parishes, one phone in each parish.

92
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:36,650
And since it’s a bar, people would go to the bar or store and make a call.

93
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,720
Uh-huh.

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,410
Mhm.

95
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,420
It was like a public service.

96
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,860
Yes, it was useful.

97
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,290
A public phone inside a sanatorium.

98
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,400
That’s why it’s answered.

99
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:53,300
This phone is sometimes used by people playing in front.

100
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,720
In front.

101
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,290
Meaning inside this place we are talking from.

102
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,320
The phone is inside the room.

103
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,050
The phone cannot be removed because people need it.

104
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,070
They would break everything.

105
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,590
Nothing more to say.

106
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,550
No, don’t come in here.

107
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,810
In Bella Unión, there’s none.

108
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,670
There’s one upstairs.

109
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:17,670
Not inside the office, but people can use it.

110
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,400
And we are close to the…

111
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,650
And the entrance to the school.

112
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,270
Inside the university?

113
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,090
Yes, this line is in an educational center.
Aqui está a tradução do seu SRT para inglês, mantendo o mesmo formato pronto para uso:

114
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,020
The bell just rang.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,010
I answered it because it started ringing, but…

116
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,120
Because the phone rang.

117
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,340
I mean, it was strange that it rang, so I went to answer it.

118
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,460
And I went by luck, and indeed.

119
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,400
Haven’t they ever called here?

120
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,540
Sometimes, not.

121
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,290
No, not much.

122
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:00,460
Now that I’m in the room, I saw them ringing, so I answered.

123
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,530
But no, no, we haven’t said anything.

124
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,510
Do the kids use it more to call than to…?

125
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,860
To receive calls.

126
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,540
It’s very rare.

127
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,700
It’s very rare.

128
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,070
No, it doesn’t receive calls either.

129
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,590
Maybe they call one person all year.

130
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,910
No one complains.

131
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,880
Because, of course, with mobiles, nobody complains about the phone.

132
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,740
Now, cell phones replaced public phones.

133
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,540
So it doesn’t…

134
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,380
No, it hasn’t…

135
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:32,770
Mobiles.

136
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,340
Cell phones?

137
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,040
Yes, yes, yes, many.

138
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,790
Some homes even have four or five cell phones.

139
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,460
Normally, they have two mobile devices per person.

140
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,300
Ah, I didn’t know that.

141
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,320
Yes, I didn’t know.

142
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,990
Later, it became coin-operated and…

143
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,510
And now it’s no longer used.

144
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:57,040
You can call with a card or with money, both options.

145
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:00,010
If you deposit money, you can talk.

146
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,060
Do they have a booth?

147
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,960
They have a booth where they can have privacy.

148
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:06,850
Well, look, I’ll tell you something.

149
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,630
Excuse me for a second.

150
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:11,590
Look, this is a restaurant and we are right in the middle of meals.

151
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,850
If you want, you can call me later.

152
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,200
Yes, I’ll answer you with no problem.

153
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,440
Okay.

154
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:14,710
Alright.

155
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:15,010
Alright.

156
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,670
Thanks.

157
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,900
You can ask for Roberto.

158
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,500
Or Margarita?

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,010
Don’t worry.

160
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,000
Either one.

161
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:19,330
Okay.

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:19,750
Go ahead.

163
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,110
Thanks.

164
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,650
You too.

165
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,070
See you.

166
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:21,580
Bye.

167
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:21,820
Bye.

168
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,920
Attention.

169
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:53,360

Thank you.

173
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,510
The phone you are calling is not available at this time.

174
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,030
Please try again later.

175
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,120
CNT informs you that the number you dialed does not exist.

176
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,330
Please consult the CNT Information Service.

177

We’re sorry, the number you are calling is unavailable at this moment.

178
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,570

00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,560
The dialed number is not available.

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,570
We suggest calling later.

181
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,150
The number you are calling is busy.

182
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,350
Dear customer, the number you dialed is out of service.

183
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,280
Thank you.

184
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:48,740
Hello.

185
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,400
The call dropped today.

186
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,570
Can you repeat that?

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,110
Of course.

188
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:52,770
What?

189
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,470
What do you mean the call dropped?

190
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,130
You’ll have to call.

191
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,540
This is a public phone.

192
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,080
It’s, uh…

193
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,160
Ah.

194
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,360
You have to call another time.

195
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,020
Another?

196
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,250
Well, another time.

197
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,150
Alright.

198
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,320
Okay.

199
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,260
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

200
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,400
Uh.

201
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,200
No.

202
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,060
Bye.

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,450
Alright.

204
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:16,530
Bye.

Well.

209
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,810
It’s not a public one.

210
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,410
My dear.

211
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,670
Eh?

212
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,190
Can I give you a public number in Trinidad?

213
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,970

214

00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:22,720
Hello.

233
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,410
Good afternoon.

234
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,250
Good afternoon.

235
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,240
Good afternoon.

236
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:25,780
Hello.

237
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,470
Hello.

238
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,070
Good afternoon.

239
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,430
Yes, speaking.

240
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:27,820
Yes?

241
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,240
Yes?

242
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,010
Tell me, tell me, tell me, speak.

243
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,520
Speak.

244
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:30,970
Speak.

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,600
Yes, speak.

246
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

247
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:33,910
But…

248
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,870
What’s your name?

249
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,440
Silvia.

250
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,000
My name is Vanessa Rodríguez.

251
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,200
Inés Rosario.

252
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,220
But don’t call me Zuli.

253
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:44,050
I’m talking from the city of Bella Unión, Artigas Department, here, on the border with Brazil.

254
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,220
Calling from Brazil.

255
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,670
Eh?

256
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,360
In Galicia.

257
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,430
In Galicia.

258
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:46,790
Lugo.

259
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,510
Flag.

260
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:52,310
The father from Santo José in Camagüey is not there.

261
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,150
From Pousadoiro in Ribera de Piquín.

262
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,190
So I can give you Cuba.

263
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:58,700
Trinidad.

264
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,440
Jamaica in Guantánamo.

265
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,430
Paso de Patria.

266
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,350
Ñeembucú, Cuba, Cienfuegos.

267
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,760
Canelones, Uruguay.

268
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,300
Also from here in Uruguay with Brazil and Argentina.

269
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,370
You’ve never been to Trinidad.

270
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:13,970
But no.

271
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,370
You have to come to Trinidad.

272
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,780
You must have Trinidad.

273
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,800
Yes, exactly.

274
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:22,070
Of course I’ll visit, I have several [people/places].

275
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,300
Me.

276
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,340
I’d love to meet you.

277
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,900
You can come by here to see.

278
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,310
Yes.

279
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:29,600
There.

280
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,770
To see.

281
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,340
To visit?

282
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,170
No, here.

283
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,410
Here in Bella Unión we have five “frijoles.”

284
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:42,770
So we are close to the museums, close to the stairs, close to the church.

285
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,340
All.

286
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,080
Yes, close to the church?

287
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,770
Yes.

288
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,390
There’s a lot to see here.

289
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,290
Yes, quite a lot.

290
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,330
Are there many restaurants?

291
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,140
All of them?

292
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:51,830
No.

293
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,050
So do you think one day we’ll be able to meet?

294
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,190
Yes, of course.

295
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,390
Yes, yes.

296
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:00,590
And when will you come?

297
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,210
When will you come to Cuba?

298
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,370
Actually, soon.

299
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,870
To see my life.

300
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,800
Hahaha.

301
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,810
So I’d very kindly like to meet you and offer you my home.

302
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,290
Eh?

303
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:15,890
So.

304
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,190
Yes.

305
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,570
I live here.

306
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,230
Here in Trinidad, near the Calvary of the Three Crosses.

307
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,490
I live here.

308
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,590
If you ask for the public phone of Las Tres Cruces, they’ll immediately tell you yes.

309
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,150
Ah, okay, I hope you come.

310
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,690
I hope to see you to show you many things.

311
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,350
Exactly.

312
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,090
Here is my…

313
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,680
My house.

314
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:37,940
Yes, yes, yes.

315
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:38,570
Come.

316
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:38,780
Yes.

317
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,110
Ah, okay, I’ll call, it’s very pleasant for me.

318
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:51,420
And truly, it was a pleasure because you made my day; I had gone to the living room here and answered the phone.

319
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,760
I really enjoyed talking to you; I really enjoyed talking to you.

320
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,930
Ah, right?

321
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,880
Same here.

322
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,740
Keep calling.

323
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,420
Later I’ll call you at nine, whenever you want, at whatever time you want.

324
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,720
If I can connect, I have to study.

325
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,260
Go my…

326
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,590
Life.

327
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, well.

328
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,500
Well.

329
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,220
Okay, okay.

You’re welcome.

Thanks.

341
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:22,470
Well, nothing.

Nothing.

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:25,710
Nothing.

Take care.

349
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:27,690
Well, well.

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,260
Okay.
